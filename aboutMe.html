		<p id="aboutmepara">Hi, I'm Nicole!</br></br> I'm finishing up my BA in Human Computer Interaction (self-created major - ask me about it!) at Brandeis University this coming May 2019. I'm also wrapping up a Biology major and a Music minor; it's quite a range I know - I went through a proper journey to get to where I am today. </br></br> Before I knew I wanted to do interaction design, I actually started off college on the pre-med track while also taking some computer science courses out of curiosity and interest. I liked computer science at first, but it didn't seem like the perfect fit for me after a while. I have always had an artistic inclination and I like engaging with people. Long story short, a lot of internet articles, a semester abroad filled with amazing HCI courses, and a good amount of soul searching later, I found my way to Interaction Design. </br></br>I am an aspiring UX Designer and Product Designer excited about creating and designing technology that enhances people's experiences and fits seamlessly into their day to day lives. You will most often find me zoned in on a wireframe, workflow, or prototype design which I could happily work on and improve for hours, but the opportunity to talk to users will gladly draw me out. There is no greater joy than watching users have a seamless and enjoyable interaction with a piece of technology, so I will always strive to ensure that through my designs.</br></br>Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio. Want to talk more? Let's get coffee (or tea - my preferred)! </p>
