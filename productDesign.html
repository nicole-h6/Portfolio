		<p id="uqlyfeDescription">Four other team members and I created a proof of concept prototype for a concept that would target the problem space of active communities within Social and Mobile Computing. Our idea was an application that could be the unified platform for all clubs, societies, and events held on our university's campus. I provided input in every step of the process from initial research and user testing to low-fidelity prototypes and finally our high fidelity usable product. My contributions allowed me to practice skills in graphic design, user experience design, user interface design, and web design.</p>

			<p>51 students including myself worked over 13 weeks to create an MMORPG (a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, such as World of Warcraft, but ours definitely only works on a smaller scale). The large group was split into teams of 3 or 4 with computer scientists and designers placed strategically for maximum quality and output. Kanban project management theory was used to streamline the process. Teams communicated independently, and the entire group participated in a standup once a week to update all other teams on progress and future goals. My individual contributions included designing backgrounds, sprites, and music, along with orchestrating a lot of user testing throughout the entire process.
