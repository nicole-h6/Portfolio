		<p id="organIzeDescription">I designed this application with a friend to explore technology's use in the learning sciences and see how learning science theory could be applied to teaching college level anatomy. We used ideas such as scaffolding, metacognition, problem-based learning, and many more concepts from the learning sciences to create a tool that would be effective in helping students learn in theis particular area. The learning platform is designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of human anatomy than they could simply through lectures and labs in existing curriculums. It enables students to interact with one another and learn from each other as they work together to make sense of a case study that is presented to them in increments week by week as the semester goes on. Students can take notes directly on the platform, chat, and complete weekly reports on the platform together. They can also enter relevant information about interactions between body parts or organ systems on the interactive human body model at the center platform to help visualize the issues presented in the case. The two of us executed every step of this design process ourselves from conceptalizing to sketching wireframes to usability testing to creating higher fidelity prototypes, and finally to having a proof-of-concept prototype that could be presented. There is still much to explore and many unanswered questions to investigate in order to improve this product. This is by no means a complete and perfected product, though nothing ever really is, but perhaps someday I will have the chance to dive into it again.</p>

		<p id="uqlyfeDescription">Four other team members and I created a proof of concept prototype for a concept that would target the problem space of active communities within Social and Mobile Computing. Our idea was an application that could be the unified platform for all clubs, societies, and events held on our university's campus. I provided input in every step of the process from initial research and user testing to low-fidelity prototypes and finally our high fidelity usable product. My contributions allowed me to practice skills in graphic design, user experience design, user interface design, and web design.</p>

			<p>51 students including myself worked over 13 weeks to create an MMORPG (a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, such as World of Warcraft, but ours definitely only works on a smaller scale). The large group was split into teams of 3 or 4 with computer scientists and designers placed strategically for maximum quality and output. Kanban project management theory was used to streamline the process. Teams communicated independently, and the entire group participated in a standup once a week to update all other teams on progress and future goals. My individual contributions included designing backgrounds, sprites, and music, along with orchestrating a lot of user testing throughout the entire process.
