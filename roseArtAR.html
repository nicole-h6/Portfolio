		<p>Please excuse my appearance, this page is still under construction as this project is still in progress. Feel free to browse and see what I've got so far.<p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The Rose Art Museum sits on the periphery of Brandeis University's campus in Waltham, MA. It has showcased many exciting exhibits through the years, and it has an extensive permanent colletion most people do not even know about. One of the most intriguing exhibits is the Mark Dion Undisciplined Collector's room. This room is carefully curated to showcase items that all predate 1962, and all are pulled from either the Rose Art permanent collection, the Brandeis Library archives, or the Brandeis Archaeology Department archives. Some of these items are objects used in everyday life in the 1950s-60s to paint a picture of daily life at the time, some are antiques from long before, some are memorabilia that were donated to the school, and some are works of art. Museum-goers are encouraged to touch and interact with items that are not encased in glass, and the exhibit is aiming to be tangible and immersive. </p>

		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>Though museum staff are always stationed close to the exhibit to inform people that they can enter this collectors room and touch almost whatever they like, even choose a record to play on the record player, I often observe tentative eyes and hands. People are not accustomed to having the freedom to touch in an art museum, and that is currently a barrier to their experience. When people do happen to touch and pick objects up, there is not much more to their experience with the object other than that. They gain no extra knowledge about the object or the world it is used in other than the texture, weight, and look of it. Even so, this exhibit is yearning to be immersive and interactive, and while it is intriguing as is, it can be so much more, and leave a much greater impact.</p>

		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<p>I am collaborating with the museum as well as a software developer to create an Augmented Reality application to be used in this space. I am working as the project lead as well as the UX designer and visual designer. Augmented Reality takes the real world environment through a camera lens, and adds more onto it using computer generated perceptual information. This application bridges the gap between the objects in the room and people's fear of touching them. It allows users to experience the objects in a whole new way and actually gain deeper insights about them further than picking them up and putting them down. Augmented reality is a powerful new technology that is very exciting to explore especially in terms of how users perceive it and interact with it. I believe it can make many experiences not only more exciting, but more accessible. This application enhances the museum and exhibit experience for users, and it makes the room come alive.</p>

		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p>There are eight objects in this exhibit that are targets that trigger augmented reality interactions. Most of these objects have been 3D scanned using the Vuforia 3D scanning app so the camera can recognize these objects from any angle. Each interaction is designed to be a brief but immersive experience that allows users to learn a little more about life during the 1950s-60 or more about the objects themselves. Users start off with a tutorial that teaches them how to use and iteract with the app and AR. From there, users are allowed to explore the exhibit freely and try to find the object targets. Each object target discovered unlocks a puzzle piece. If all 8 pieces are found and collected, the user unlocks a final video to culminate the experience. However, this is designed to be a worthwhile experience even if the user does not reach the very end by finding every single object and corresponding puzzle piece. </p>
