		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>I did this project with three other team members as a way to investigate how computer mediated collaboration could be used to help executive board members of clubs at Brandeis University better plan and coordinate events.</p>

		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Many clubs run on a hierarchical model where those at the top must spend a lot of time and energy planning, executing, delegating, and reminding other members of the club's tasks and events. We believed this was a good problem space to implement computer mediated collaboration because through our designs we could encourage club members to work on a more egalitarian model. Everyone through this model would be given more responsibility and opportunities to contribute while also being held accountable by the rest of thei club members. </p>

		<p>This web platform is designed to be used by club members in both synchronous and asynchronous temporal situations, but only non-collocated spatial situations. This should essentially be used whenever club members are not in meetings together. Main features on this platform include: </p>

		<ul>	
			<li>Calendar</li>
			<li>To-do List</li>
			<li>Chat</li>
			<li>Forum</li>
			<li>Shared Document Editing</li>
			<li>Access to Resources</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The calendar and todo list help decrease team opacity by making it visible to everybody when events and deadlines are, and who is assigned to which tasks. The chat capabilities are organized into channels similar to slack to allow easy group creation and topic-related discussions. User's availbability is also displayed - this all makes chatting with any member of the club more accessible. The forum acts as a knowledge-building community where club leaders can go to for help and discussion when it comes to different club processes. The shared document editing, much like google docs, allows students to edit at the same time or different times when they are not collocated with version histories automatically saved. This allows more students to be involved and have easy access to club documents. These shared documents also have a verification feature to help members verify certain sections that are complete in order to collectively shift their focus to other parts of the document. Finally, access to resources such as the club listserv, allocations board(A-board), and student union management system(Sums) helps increase transparency across the entire club community and ensures any club member knows these resources are available and where to go to utilize these resources.</p>
