		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Colleges and Universities around the world all share a common problem - there are so many events around campus that are held by different organizations, clubs, or academic departments; event creators don't have any dependable method of advertising their event to the entire school popultion, and students don't know where to go to find this information. I created this app with a group of 5 students when I was in Brisbane, Australia to solve this probelm by making a unified platform for any event-related activities (ie: creating events, browsing events in real time, saving future events you are interested in, etc.) at our school - The University of Queensland. </p>

		<!-- do pics of user personas and bullet descriptions /-->
		<p>This project required us to investigate and hone a lot of different methods of creating a social and mobile solution in the community problem domain space. We created user personas to understand who we were creating this app for, and we did a lot of external research and user testing throughout the entire process. We investigated the merits of gamefication to motivate students to use the app and ensure more traffic on the app. Of the many moving parts that went into this project, my main focus was event creation.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>I started with paper prototypes. The main challenge was to figure out how to display all the necessary fields in such a small space. I created 2 versions of the first iteration that only differed in whether fields were full boxes or just underlines to do some A/B testing with. In this iteration I presented everything on the screen without need for scrolling. </p>

		<div class="">
			<img src="uqLyfePaper1.png" class="uqLyfePaper" alt="uqLyfePaper1" width="32%">
			<img src="uqLyfePaper2.png" class="uqLyfePaper" alt="uqLyfePaper2" width="32%">
			<img src="uqLyfePaper3.png" class="uqLyfePaper" alt="uqLyfePaper3" width="32%">
		</div>

		<p>From there I made a digital prototype to be used for further user testing</p>

		<div class="imageUQLyfe">
			<img src="uqLyfe2old.png" id="uqLyfe2old" alt="uqLyfe2old" width="50%">
		</div>

		<p>Response from this prototype made it clear to me that the form was too overwhelming and looked daunting with all the fields squeezed onto the one screen. The sharp edges added to the harshness of the overall look. Users indicated that they would be unlikely to complete this entire form to create an event if it had the current design. This all led to a major redesign for the next iteration. </p>

		<div class="">
			<img src="uqLyfe1.png" class="uqLyfe3" alt="uqLyfe1" width="32%">
			<img src="uqLyfe2.png" class="uqLyfe3" alt="uqLyfe2" width="32%">
			<img src="uqLyfe3.png" class="uqLyfe3" alt="uqLyfe3" width="32%">
		</div>

		<p>In this iteration I used softer colors and corners. I also spread each field of the form out more so that scrolling is needed but not everything is squeezed onto one screen. To further scaffold the process and make it seem more attainable, I added steps as well as a visual at the top to monitor progress and make the task seem short and simple. Users responded positively to all these changes and indicated that they had a much better experience now creating an event.</p>
