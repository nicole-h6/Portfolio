		<p> Hi! My name is Nicole Huang; I am currently a student at Brandeis University, and I am an aspiring User Designer and Human Computer Interaction professional. My mind allows me to blend logic and creativity seamlessly, and I love working with people in any capacity. I have experience developing ideas from the ground up and having a hand in every aspect of the product development from low-fidelity prototyping and wireframing, to usability testing and rounds upon rounds of iterating, and finally to presenting a product ready for the market. I also have experience doing detailed work on specific features that contribute to the whole of much larger projects. I've worked in groups that range from 5 members to over 50 members, and I have been involved with projects that were done for clients as well as projects done for myself or my own team. I have a personality that is very easy to get along with, and I always design with the user in mind. I have a lot of good experience, but I am always looking to learn more. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio! </p>
