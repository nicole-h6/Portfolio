		<p> Hi! My name is Nicole Huang; I am currently a student at Brandeis University, and I am an aspiring User Designer and Human Computer Interaction professional. My mind allows me to blend logic and creativity seamlessly, and I love working with people in any capacity. I have experience developing ideas from the ground up and having a hand in every aspect of the product development; I also have experience working on specific features that contribute to the whole of much larger projects. I've worked in groups that range from 5 members to over 50 members. I have a personality that is very easy to get along with, and I always design with the user in mind. While I have a some experience, I am always eager to learn more. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio! </p>
