		<p> Hi! My name is Nicole Huang; I am currently a student at Brandeis University, and I am an aspiring User Designer and Human Computer Interaction professional. My career direction has taken many turns in the recent years as I've continued to seek out what my passion is and where my strengths and skills can be adequately applied. Discovering User Experience and HCI has excited me greatly as it blends together my love for technology, design and creativity, and human interaction. I no longer have to fight the yearnings of my right mind, the part of my mind that loves music, art, and theater, in order to find a suitable and realistic career path. Instead, I now have the opportunity to exercise both sides of my mind in work that I believe has every growing importance and relevance in our world today. </p>
